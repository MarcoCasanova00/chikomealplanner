Another personal project to plan my weekly meal consumption with white rice base.
I plan on implementing a cost calculator, that's why the classes have name+cost objects, basically the price object now it's not used but I plan on implementing it.

This is my first use of classes in my python learning journey.
Also, the first time I import other files and call it from the main script.

I coded it in 30 minutes in Italian as it is only a learning/utility personal project, but it serves my purpose perfectly.
Aesthetically I've played around too. 

I can add ingredients in the ingredients.py file which is a collection of classes. Three classes were made: proteins, side dishes and sauces.
The main script will randomize the ingredients which will form two daily meals with 1 protein, 2 side dishes and 1 sauce.
It will attach a cute japanese style emoji and a funny phrase after the "recipe". I can change/add/remove the phrases by editing the related file, frasi_random.py.
