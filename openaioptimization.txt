To optimize your code, here are some suggestions:

1. Import Only Required Modules: It seems that you're importing the entire module "ingredienti" and "frasi_random". If you only need specific functions or variables from these modules, consider importing only those instead of importing the entire module. It can improve performance and reduce unnecessary memory usage.

2. Move Constant Variables Outside the Loop: In your `randomizzatore` function, the lists `proteine_li`, `contorni_li`, and `salse_li` are defined inside the function. Since these lists don't change during the execution of the function, it's better to define them outside the function to avoid recreating them each time the function is called.

3. Avoid Redundant Math.ceil() Calls: In the `randomizzatore` function, you are using `math.ceil` on the `prezzo` values of `random_1`, `random_2`, and `random_3`. Since `prezzo` is already a float value, it's unnecessary to use `math.ceil` on it.

4. Use f-Strings for String Formatting: Instead of concatenating strings with the `+` operator, you can use f-strings (formatted string literals) for better readability and performance. Replace the concatenation in lines like `print(random_1.nome + random_2.nome + random_3.nome + random_4.nome + random_phrase)` with `print(f"{random_1.nome}{random_2.nome}{random_3.nome}{random_4.nome}{random_phrase}")`.

5. Use a Loop for Weekdays: Instead of repeating the same lines of code for each day (LUNEDI, MARTEDI, etc.), you can use a loop to iterate over the weekdays and call the `randomizzatore` function inside the loop.
